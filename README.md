# mRNA-VACCINE-DEGRADATION-PREDICTION

### Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global demand for effective vaccines to protect individuals from the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. One of the most promising vaccines that have emerged is the mRNA vaccines, which have demonstrated high efficacy rates in clinical trials. However, these vaccines are susceptible to degradation under varying storage conditions, which can compromise their efficacy and pose a safety risk. Therefore, accurate prediction of mRNA vaccine degradation rates under different storage conditions is crucial to enhance their stability and effectiveness.

### Procedure to Implement the Code
1. Load the train and test dataset into Base Model "Training.py"
2. Run the file and extract model weights for all the 5 models
3. Load the models and the private_test_data into "Meta Model Prediction.py"
4. Run the file to get the output
